<h1>Hey there! Welcome to My GitHub Page!</h1>
<p>I'm so glad you found your way to my GitHub page. I'm a proficient programmer and tech enthusiast who loves to share my projects and ideas with the world. On this page, you'll find a collection of my personal and class projects, along with the source code and documentation for each one.</p>
<p>Whether you're here to learn, be inspired, or just check out what I've been up to, I hope you'll find something that interests you. So go ahead and take a look around!</p>

<h3>Private Repos</h3>
<p>By the way, you may find that some of the projects are private, as they were made in the context of class projects. Those are required to be hidden per University policies =( </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub page. I hope you've found something here that intrigues you, and if you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
